=item * Ghojo::PublicUser::get_repo ( OWNER, REPO )

=item * repo_is_available( OWNER, REPO )

Return true is the repo is available, and false otherwise.

Repositories might be hidden or private, so they might appear to
not exist. The GitHub API purposedly does not distinguish between
hidden and non-existent repos.

You might want to use C<repo_check> instead. It will cache the result.

=item * get_repos_owned_by( USER, CALLBACK, ARGS )

Like C<get_repos_for_username>, but only returns repos owned by the
user.

ARGS is a hash ref that may contain any of these parameters. However,
you can sort on anything you like when you get the L<Mojo::Collection>
back.

	sort		enum{ created, updated, pushed, full_name* }
	direction	enum{ asc, desc }
